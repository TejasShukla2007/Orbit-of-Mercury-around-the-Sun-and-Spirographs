# Mercury's Orbit around the Sun and Spirographs

In this project, the orbit of Mercury around the Sun is simulated and eventually, spirographs are created using the same code. 

All the graphics in this project were rendered using the Raylib Library.

## Simulating Mercury's orbit around the Sun

In this project, the orbit of Mercury around the Sun is simulated using Newton's law of universal gravitation and astronomical data such as distance of Mercury from the Sun at perihelion and its speed at that point.

### Mercury's Orbital Precession

We can observe the phenomenon of Mercury's Orbital Precession with negligible error by speeding up the process by setting the time_scale at 10.0 to 15.0.

## Spirograph Patterns using this model

On setting the value of time scale at higher values, we lose the accuracy in simulating Mercury's orbit but beautiful patterna, such as those produced by a spirograph, are obtained.

Some such patterns along with their time_scale values are given below:

### time_scale = 95.0
