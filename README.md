# Mercury's Orbit around the Sun and Spirographs

In this project, the orbit of Mercury around the Sun is simulated and eventually, spirographs are created using the same code. 

### Simulating Mercury's orbit around the Sun

In this project, the orbit of Mercury around the Sun is simulated using Newton's law of universal gravitation and astronomical data such as distance of Mercury from the Sun at perihelion and its speed at that point. 

All the graphics in this project were rendered using Raylib Library.
